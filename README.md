##data model
There are *two* basic document types: `Document`, assembling Controversy Mapping website and Controversy Mappping delivrables; and `WorkingDocument`, assembling tools and Controversy Mappping courses. Each `Document` or `WorkingDocument` can be distiguish by subtypes.
`DocumentProfile` is where we describe each `Document` and can be connected to some `Property`. Its representation on the rest API takes the form of a survey of Q&A.

```
	DocumentProfile -------- Property
		1
		|
		|
		1	
	Document ---------------.
		|					|
		|					|
		+ Device			+ Tag
		|					|
		|					|
	WorkingDocument --------'
